This folder holds information and resources of interest for the project.  

Approximate Network Motif Mining Via Graph Learning.pdf: I will be re-implementing the algorithm from this paper and validating some of its experiments.

Original source code: The source code for the paper can be found [here]([https://www.genome.gov/](https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/MotiFiesta)) (https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/MotiFiesta).

<!---This is intended to be a convenient location for project members to access
support material for the project.-->

<!---For LaTeX files references are put in the References.bib file for processing by
BibTeX.  A nice convention for naming the references is to use the Nat Bib
convention.  That is, the citation name, and the corresponding file name should
be in the format AuthorYear.  If there is two author's the name should be
Author1Author2Year.  For more than two authors, the name should be
Author1EtAlYear.  In the preceding text, Author, Author1 and Author2 are the
last names of the authors.-->
